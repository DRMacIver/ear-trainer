# This prevents Claude from accidentally truncating or overwriting important hooks
# during updates or other operations.

#   MODIFY_HOOK="Yes I really meant to edit the autonomous-stop-hook.py hook(s) the user has said it is OK" git commit ...
#
# The value must include the names of the hooks being modified.
